As we can’t change the past, such a simulated change should only be applied to future period. The valQ Custom Visual have this capability. When performing what-if analysis, the period that a simulation should be applied from is selected in the Side Panel (current period is default):Assuming that we calculate fuel cost based on litre per month and price as $/l and we are at the end of period 9, the simulated cost should be calculated first at the monthly level with the % change applied to period 9 and onwards. Once the individual months are calculated, they can then be aggregated based on the rule of the node (sum for diesel cost, weighted average for diesel price):When hovering over a node, the bottom half of the node becomes a slider. Drag the slider left to vary the node by a negatively, drag right for positive. As you drag, the values for the selected node is dynamically recalculated and displayed. When releasing, the tree will immediately recalculate all dependent nodes and show the result.A simulation change is either a pct. Change, a fixed future price or a pct. Growth depending on the simulation model defined for the value driver.The default method for the driver can be seen on the simulation tooltip. You can also change the selected model by selecting at the bottom of the tooltip.Understanding that a change is applied to the selected periods only is particularly important to understand when displaying the Full Year value and the node is using a weighted average. The displayed value is the weighted average value for the full year, not the value for future periods.A simplified example will help understanding this critical concept. Let’s assume that the diesel price is $1.014 for all periods and the monthly fuel consumption is constant as well at 1m litres and we have selected period 9 as we want to apply the simulation to the remaining periods of the year.We now drag the slider for the fuel price to the right and the node will show the new weighted average value. Let’s say we drag it to the right so the full year weighted average is $1.030. As the first 8 periods were $1.014, the weighted average of $1.030 means that the simulated price change is equivalent of a future fuel price of $1.20. To better understand the individual future period simulations when looking a Full Year aggregated number, it is useful to pay attention to the Month Data also shown on the node. The real world is a little more complex as the price is not necessarily the same every month and the fuel consumed is unlikely to be constant as well. Below is an example of such a simulation based on a real data set:The weighted average price was 1.014. We now simulated a 2% increase in the prices selected and future periods which equates to a new weighted average price of 1.030. If you look at the month Value, you can see for the selected month, this equates to the higher price of 1.195.Multiple variations can be applied in parallel as they are expressed as pct. The top left % indicate the cumulative impact on this particular node of all simulation that impacts it.Any node with a variation will have the blue pen icon in the top middle showing the percentage the node has been varied with. For quick what-if analysis at any level and a dynamic work process from the general to the specific, you can apply a simulation on any level.Certain nodes may have been locked from changes in the model. This is generally when there is a specific reason not to vary this node directly for consistency purposes. A locked node will not have the grey pen iconor a slider when hovering.Certain nodes may be displayed multiple times in the tree. An example is Material Moved as it affects Mining and Mill Throughput. In these scenarios, one node is linked to the other. If you simulate a change in a linked node, the node it is pointing to is instead changed so it applies both to the selected node and anywhere else where the driver is used. If a node is a linked node, it has the Linked node text in the bottom right corner:"},{"title":"General features of ValQ Custom Visual","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/general/getting-started","content":""},{"title":"What is a Value Driver Modeling?","type":1,"pageTitle":"General features of ValQ Custom Visual","url":"docs/general/getting-started#what-is-a-value-driver-modeling","content":"Explanation of the concept of a Value Driver Models with a business scenario.

"},{"title":"Input Data","type":1,"pageTitle":"General features of ValQ Custom Visual","url":"docs/general/getting-started#input-data","content":"The valQ Custom Visual works with two input data series – the primary and the comparison data series. A common way of using this is to compare Forecast vs Budget, Budget vs Last Year Actuals etc. The data series is at a certain time grain. This would typically be 1 year by 12 months or a multiyear view like 5 years plan by year. The selecting of the time series will often be based on Filters or Variables. A typical scenario is where the designer has defined 4 variables on the underlying data sources: Primary: Version: ie. Defaulted to Forecast Year: ie. Defaulted to Current Year Comparison: Version ie. Defaulted to Budget Year ie. Defaulted to Current Year This allows the users to compare different versions and years in the value driver tree model. The valQ Custom Visual can display individual periods but can also apply time aggregation such as Full Year, Year-to-Date. You can see the currently selected Value Display aggregation on the Navigation Panel. In the screenshot above, Full Year is selected. The primary value displayed on the Widgets is therefore in this instance the Full Year aggregated data.

The designer can link certain nodes to a user selected scaling. You can select the scale you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section. Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical volumes. In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the Month data as secondary:  The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period selected. When Month is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate, we generally don’t want to apply a change to the past as we can’t change it. It is possible to also set the ‘to’ period in a simulation, just click and highlight the month you want as the end period of a simulation. This is however a special scenario.  YTD – the selected period -1 is the year to date data (eg. selected simulation period is September to December, the YTD data will be from Jan to August). Note: Simulation of future periods will not impact the YTD data.  Full Year – Shows the full year cumulated data  Sim. Period – to simulate a specific period, for example a 3 month rolling forecast from September to November, click the first month September then click and click the last month November for simulation. You can then choose to only show the values aggregated for the selected simulation periods  As part of the New Release, you will be able to view the Tooltip for all the Value Displays.

This is the technical formula that is used to calculate individual period values. To calculate the real values, all simulation variations that affects the node are applied to selected and future periods and the aggregation rules for the node is applied (sum or weighted average).The trend chart compares the simulated value to the comparison version as well as showing the original value as the dotted line on the bar if simulation variations are active. If you hover over the bar, you will the see the details for the period.The table on the top right shows the period and full year values and the variance calculations as per the definition previously in this document.The valQ Custom Visual also analyses all the active simulations to see if any impacts this particular node.

Configuration","type":1,"pageTitle":"Node","url":"docs/model/node#2-configuration","content":"In Configuration, you will be able to configure the node details such as Node Type, Calculation Method, Time Aggregation, Desired Trend and Value Range with the values as shown in the below Figure.    Node Type: Node can be of two types - Normal and Constant. Normal node is the default type with all the options available while constant node sets the node value to a fixed figure.   Calculation Method: This option is available to choose a method of calculation for the node from the below-seen list of methods.   Method Description 1 Data Source Gets the value directly from source data 2 Sum Children Adds all of the child node values 3 Subtract Children Deducts the other child node values from the first child node 4 Multiply Children Multiplies all of the child node values 5 Divide Children Divides the other child node values from the first child node 6 Formula Calculates and applies the custom formula entered by the user 7 Linked to Node The value is linked to value from another node 8 Template based on other node Captures and applies the configuration from the other node 9 Manual Enter the values manually   Note On selecting 'Formula' and clicking on the formula field, you will be able to see a dropdown of the formulas that are supported. For a list of formulas that are available in ValQ, you can refer to the link Functions  The Normal node type presents the user with all the calculation methods as shown below.   The constant node type only makes the following calculation methods available for the user to choose from.   For the Calculation Method being selected as 'Data Source', you can follow the steps as explained in the following link: https://valq.com/blogs/3-methods-of-mapping-valq-nodes-to-data For other options of Calculation Method, you can refer the link: https://valq.com/blogs/assigning-values-to-nodes-in-valq/  #Template Nodes You can create a Template Node for an already existing node. Add a new node and select its Calculation Method as Template based on other nodes. Now select the node you want to copy under node to use as a template.  In the below Figure as an example, we create another node 'North' with a template the same as that of the 'East' node by following the steps mentioned above. Unique Id Prefix has also been set as North.    Here you can observe that 'North' node with the same structure as 'East' node has been created.   Source Key: The Source Key option gets displayed when the Calculation Method is selected as Data Source. Note that you shall select the Source Key that matches the node to get the correct value. The below image is an example that shows the Source Key with all the levels of category for quick identification and selection.    Time Aggregation: Based on the Time period field added to the model, you can choose from a range of Time Aggregation options to get the values displayed on the node accordingly.   Time Aggregation Description 1 Sum of Periods Adds all of the period values 2 Average Average of the period values gets displayed 3 Formula Calculates and applies the custom formula entered by the user 4 Last Only last period value of the node gets displayed 5 Cumulative Cumulative value of the period node gets displayed   The Normal node type presents the user with the Time Aggregation options as seen below.    Note The constant node type doesn't have Time Aggregation as the value is fixed. Although Sum of Periods and Cummulative both show the same result on top of the node, there is a difference between the two on the line chart. Click on the 'East' node to see a detailed report along with the graph plotted with the period values. From the below images we can see that the first one having Time Aggregation as Sum of Periods captures the movement of the period values and the latter one having Cummulative as Time Aggregation displays the running total.  'East' node having Time Aggregation as Sum of Periods   'East' node having Time Aggregation as Cumulative   Desired Trend: The Desired Trend can be set as Increase or Decrease depending on the context of the Node. For instance, income has an increasing trend and expenses have a decreasing trend.     The Desired trend impacts the Conditional Formatting while performing simulations. The impact of Desire Trend on Conditional Formatting has been discussed along with examples here.  Value Range: Value Range helps you to assign Minimum and Maximum value for a node. This option comes in handy at the time of simulation of the node for which threshold has been set to evaluate it's performance against the benchmark i.e. Constraint.    In the following example, Value Range has been added to a node and the Constraint for that particular node has been activated under Settings.  A. The Value Range for 'East' Node has been set as Min = 1 Million and Max = 10 Million. Notice that the Time Aggregation has been set as Sum of Periods and the number of periods for this node is 12. Therefore, the Value Range is taken as Min = 12 Million and Max = 120 Million.    B. After the Value Range has been set to the 'East' node, the same node is added to Constraint under the Navigation Panel. To add Constraint, Model -> Settings -> Navigation Panel -> Constraints and choose constraints from the drop-down to be listed.    C. The Constraint for 'East' node has been added with the Minimum and Maximum values as seen below. Notice that the node value is outside the Value Range and the node value is displayed in red color. The value gets displayed in white color if it lies within the range.    You can also learn about Constraints, here.Dynamic Children: Dynamic Children is available to create a new node that is replicate of another existing node having Data Source as it's Calculation Method. The new node works like a Simple Model where you cannot configure the child nodes except for simulation. Dynamic Children Simulation has options to decide whether to allow simulation of child nodes. All allow simulation for all the child nodes, nodes w/o children allow simulation only for nodes without children i.e. nodes on the last level and none doesn't allow simulation for any of the nodes including the parent.    The below example shows how to create Dynamic Children from Data Source.  First, we create a new node 'Copy of Overall Result' with the Calculation method as Data Source and 'East' as Source Key. Here, we enable the option Dynamic Children from Data Source and choose 'None' as Dynamic Children Simulation.  As a result of the above configuration, you will see the screen as below image.   Now to be able to configure the child nodes of the node created using the option Dynamic Children from Data Source, you click on the magic wand available next to the top node. The entire ValQ model is now an Advanced Model as seen below.   "},{"title":"3.

Global or Inherited Rule: When the option \"Global or Inherited Rule\" is selected, the Conditional Formatting Rules configured as Global Rule in the Settings tab will be applied to the node.  Custom Rule: Custom Rule option overwrites default or any inherited rule to the rule as per our preference. The Custom Rule option can be configured based on the variance percentage or value and it gets applied at the period level. Checking Apply to Descendants option applies the Custom Rule to the child nodes as well.   Custom Rule is indicated by the icon (see Figure below) on the node in the Navigation Panel.   Hidden Rule: With this option, you can observe that no range values can be provided for the Conditional Formatting and hence there will be no status color for the node upon being simulated.  In the below example, we choose the option for the Custom Rule as \"Percentage\" and also enable the property \"Apply to Descendants\". We set the threshold values as shown in the below Figure. After the simulation, you can find that the variance percentage value for the node \"East\" falls in the threshold range (5%)* which is between -10% to -1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Node East is yellow color (see Figure below).      Also, you can observe that the Descendant node \"Consumer\" has been updated with the same threshold settings based on our configuration. The variance percentage value for the Descendant node \"Consumer\" falls in the threshold range (3%)* which is Above 1% and based on that condition, the status bar for the Descendant node \"Consumer\" is green color. While the node 'East' has a variance of (4%)* which is within the threshold range and hence the status bar is yellow. (see Figure below)     Note \"*\" denotes that the metric values get calculated based on the Period Level.

The underlying data (referred to by the term ‘base data series’ usually comes from an external source such as a spreadsheet or a SQL database. This underlying data source cannot be directly modified in the Simulate tab (to maintain integrity of data). Instead, the Simulate tab allows us to create several scenarios on top of this base data series (with each scenario operating on a copy of the base data series). As a result, there is a logical separation between base data series (the original data supplied to the model) vs. scenario data (scenarios created by users).  But what if the baseline data itself needs to be updated? Consider this use case where you need to utilize the actuals for 2020 to create a baseline budget for 2021. Here instead of simulating for 2021, it is better to create a new baseline plan for 2021, on which multiple simulations can be run. That’s where the Plan tab can help.
