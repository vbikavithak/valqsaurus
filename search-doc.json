As we can’t change the past, such a simulated change should only be applied to future period. The ValQ visual have this capability. When performing what-if analysis, the period that a simulation should be applied from is selected in the Side Panel (current period is default): Assuming that we calculate fuel cost based on litre per month and price as \\$/l and we are at the end of period 9, the simulated cost should be calculated first at the monthly level with the % change applied to period 9 and onwards. Once the individual months are calculated, they can then be aggregated based on the rule of the node (sum for diesel cost, weighted average for diesel price): When hovering over a node, the bottom half of the node becomes a slider. Drag the slider left to vary the node by a negatively, drag right for positive. As you drag, the values for the selected node is dynamically recalculated and displayed. When releasing, the tree will immediately recalculate all dependent nodes and show the result. A simulation change is either a pct. Change, a fixed future price or a pct. Growth depending on the simulation model defined for the value driver. The default method for the driver can be seen on the simulation tooltip. You can also change the selected model by selecting at the bottom of the tooltip. Understanding that a change is applied to the selected periods only is particularly important to understand when displaying the Full Year value and the node is using a weighted average. The displayed value is the weighted average value for the full year, not the value for future periods. A simplified example will help understanding this critical concept. Let’s assume that the diesel price is \\$1.014 for all periods and the monthly fuel consumption is constant as well at 1m litres and we have selected period 9 as we want to apply the simulation to the remaining periods of the year. We now drag the slider for the fuel price to the right and the node will show the new weighted average value. Let’s say we drag it to the right so the full year weighted average is $1.030. As the first 8 periods were $1.014, the weighted average of $1.030 means that the simulated price change is equivalent of a future fuel price of $1.20. To better understand the individual future period simulations when looking a Full Year aggregated number, it is useful to pay attention to the Month Data also shown on the node. The real world is a little more complex as the price is not necessarily the same every month and the fuel consumed is unlikely to be constant as well. Below is an example of such a simulation based on a real data set: The weighted average price was 1.014. We now simulated a 2% increase in the prices selected and future periods which equates to a new weighted average price of 1.030. If you look at the month Value, you can see for the selected month, this equates to the higher price of 1.195. Multiple variations can be applied in parallel as they are expressed as pct. The top left % indicate the cumulative impact on this particular node of all simulation that impacts it. Any node with a variation will have the blue pen icon in the top middle showing the percentage the node has been varied with. For quick what-if analysis at any level and a dynamic work process from the general to the specific, you can apply a simulation on any level. Certain nodes may have been locked from changes in the model. This is generally when there is a specific reason not to vary this node directly for consistency purposes. A locked node will not have the grey pen icon or a slider when hovering. Certain nodes may be displayed multiple times in the tree. An example is Material Moved as it affects Mining and Mill Throughput. In these scenarios, one node is linked to the other. If you simulate a change in a linked node, the node it is pointing to is instead changed so it applies both to the selected node and anywhere else where the driver is used. If a node is a linked node, it has the Linked node text in the bottom right corner:","keywords":""},{"title":"Introduction","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/how_to_videos/analyze/intro","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Workspace in ValQ","type":0,"sectionRef":"#","url":"docs/general/workspace-in-valq","content":"","keywords":""},{"title":"Creating a workspace","type":1,"pageTitle":"Workspace in ValQ","url":"docs/general/workspace-in-valq#creating-a-workspace","content":"You can create a workspace at ValQ.com website by signing up for the Free Trial or purchasing ValQ from the shop.

For some nodes, the designer may have added a description beyond the title. If so, this will be displayed below the title. If a node is calculated, a simplified version of the formula is displayed. This is the technical formula that is used to calculate individual period values. To calculate the real values, all simulation variations that affects the node are applied to selected and future periods and the aggregation rules for the node is applied (sum or weighted average). The trend chart compares the simulated value to the comparison version as well as showing the original value as the dotted line on the bar if simulation variations are active. If you hover over the bar, you will the see the details for the period. The table on the top right shows the period and full year values and the variance calculations as per the definition previously in this document. The ValQ visual also analyses all the active simulations to see if any impacts this particular node. If so, it then analyses how much each of the active simulation changes contributes to the overall impact on this node and generates a waterfall diagram with the break down which is displayed in the bottom right panel. In some scenarios, you may vary multiple factors impacting the same node in a compound nature. I.e. you vary both sales volume and sales price and want to know the impact on revenue. As the sum of both changes is more than the impact of each individually, the waterfall chart breaks down each of the individual impacts and a compound impact bar.

This would typically be 1 year by 12 months or a multiyear view like 5 years plan by year. The selecting of the time series will often be based on Filters or Variables. A typical scenario is where the designer has defined 4 variables on the underlying data sources: Primary: Version: ie. Defaulted to Forecast Year: ie. Defaulted to Current Year Comparison: Version ie. Defaulted to Budget Year ie. Defaulted to Current Year This allows the users to compare different versions and years in the value driver tree model. The ValQ visual can display individual periods but can also apply time aggregation such as Full Year, Year-to-Date.

The designer can link certain nodes to a user selected scaling. You can select the scale you wish to display by selecting this under the Value Display section. Note that the options here can be configured so they may differ. It is important to note that not all notes are scaled using this as the value driver tree typically contains both amounts, prices, rates and physical volumes. In addition to the primary display value, the designer can also choose a secondary value to be displayed. I.e. if you are showing Full Year as primary, in the below example, it has been configured to visualize the Month data as secondary:  The time aggregation and display relates to the Simulation Period selected. When Month is selected, it shows the first month of the simulation interval selected. By default, the simulation period is the selected period and the future. This is an important concept as when we simulate, we generally don’t want to apply a change to the past as we can’t change it. It is possible to also set the ‘to’ period in a simulation, just click and highlight the month you want as the end period of a simulation. This is however a special scenario.  YTD – the selected period -1 is the year to date data (eg. selected simulation period is September to December, the YTD data will be from Jan to August). Note: Simulation of future periods will not impact the YTD data.  Full Year – Shows the full year cumulated data  Sim. Period – to simulate a specific period, for example a 3 month rolling forecast from September to November, click the first month September then click and click the last month November for simulation. You can then choose to only show the values aggregated for the selected simulation periods  As part of the New Release, you will be able to view the Tooltip for all the Value Displays.
